Codes that may be useful in several occasions.

## - Screenshot rename

This code was used to rename a big set of consecutive screenshots in the same directory, keeping the correct order using the time of shots as a guide. This code can be expanded adding the directory path and a more complete selection of features (checking date of the screenshot).

The code was written using Python and the packages:
- Numpy
- Os
